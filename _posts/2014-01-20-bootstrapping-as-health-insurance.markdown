title: Bootstrapping as Health Insurance
layout: post
---

Two stories of poor health kick off this week's [Bootstrapping IO](http://bootstrapping.io), but don't worry (SPOILER!) there are happy endings!

Another couple of 'looking back' posts round out our missive this week. After this no more 'year in review posts', I promise, it's getting to the end of January and no doubt we've all broken our resolutions already!

### [Your Sideproject as Insurance Policy](http://alistapart.com/column/your-side-project-as-insurance-policy)

Last year Rachel Andrew ([@rachelandrew](http://twitter.com/rachelandrew)) went for a run and "got back home five days later". Her (pretty serious) injury would have been disastrous when working in client services, did little damage to their product business [Perch](http://getaperch.com).

We hope Rachel's typing arm is back in action soon.

### [Lesson Learned](http://garrettdimon.com/post/59019035477/lesson-learned)

Another story of a founder with sudden (and pretty catastrophic) ongoing health issues. Garrett Dimon ([@garrettdimon](http://twitter.com/garrettdimon)) has been struggling with his health, for months, since [his recovery from a minor operation went badly](http://garrettdimon.com/post/57655518369/unplanned-downtime), but his product business hasn't suffered in the way that he feared.

We can only wish Garrett well in his continued recovery.

### [How Risky is Freelancing](http://planscope.io/blog/risky-freelancing/)

Brennan Dunn ([@brennandunn](http://twitter.com/brennandunn)), talks about something lots of us who have taken 'the plunge', know. That freelancing is often *less* risky than simply having a job. As many of us freelance while trying to get our more 'product-y' stuff off the ground, this is good reminder that employment isn't necessarily a more secure environment in which to bootstrap.

### [3,111 email addresses and $15k](http://www.planningforaliens.com/blog/2014/01/08/sketching-with-css/)

A story of good email list growth & sales success from Sean Fioritto ([@sfioritto](https://twitter.com/sfioritto)) for an ebook on using CSS as your 'sketching tool'. He talks tactics on early promotion and list growth and how he slightly messed up his launch. *Lots* to take away from here.

### [Tito in 2013](http://blog.tito.io/posts/tito-in-2013-a-look-back-and-a-quick-look-forward/)

I'm looking into ticketing solutions for an upcoming event and stumbled into [tito](http://tito.io). This blog post by founder Paul Campbell [@paulca](http://twitter.com/paulca) shows them having decent traction but not yet supporting themselves, hopefully 2014 will be the year.

As a bootstrapped company, with a great product, I'll be using them for any of my future events.

### [Lessons Learned](http://blog.kickofflabs.com/lessons-learned-2013/)

Sneaking into this issue, rather than last week because it's only just escaped from my Instapaper backlog. Some interesting real life experimentation from Kickoff Labs [@kickofflabs](http://twitter.com/kickofflabs). During 2013 they tested (two!) price increases, some lifecycle emails and experiments on free trials.

Until next time...
