title: 'Why Bootstrap?'
layout: post

This week, we return to 'why'. In this case why even choose the 'harder' route of trying to launch with no money.

In my case, the short version is: I've done it and I don't like the 'decision distortion' that comes with the bank transfer of a VC's money.

To that end I have another project bubbling under... if you have a bootstrapped business, or have a favorite one that you use, [let me know](mailto:andy@goodscary.com) for _early access to what I'm doing_.


### [The Internet of Small Businesses](http://chris.beams.io/posts/pinboard/)

A great piece from [@cbeams](https://twitter.com/cbeams) on the 'anomaly' of [pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in) (a great service of which I'm a customer).


### [Are You Building an App or a Business?](http://dancounsell.com/articles/are-you-building-an-app-or-a-business)

My fellow Brighton resident, [@dancounsell](http://twitter.com/dancounsell), compares the approach of VC-funded makers and those trying the bootstrapped route.


### [What Do You Want?](http://adii.me/what-do-you-want/)

[@adii](http://twitter.com/adii) goes a level deeper than 'why bootstrap over VC' to simply 'why'.

For me the appeal of bootstrapping something is the freedom and the self-direction, I'm guessing from Adii's article, that's what he's after too. Life is a balance, it's good to pay attention to what you're doing.


### [Jack Mallers: from dropout to Starter.](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3771-jack-mallers-from-dropout-to-starter)

You have to be doing something right for [@jasonfried](http://twitter.com/jasonfried) to want you to feature on SvN. Here's the story of a hungry kid who's been through the Chicago-based 'Startup School' that Basecamp are involved with.


### [Let's, Like Demolish Laundry](http://nymag.com/news/features/laundry-apps-2014-5/)

A long-form piece from the New Yorker (!) that should serve as a warning to avoid the various thought traps that having a 'disruptive' idea and VC funding can lead you into.

None of the companies featured in the story have any kind of solid foundation in what they are doing... all I took away from the article was various founding teams thrashing about as they burned other people's money.
