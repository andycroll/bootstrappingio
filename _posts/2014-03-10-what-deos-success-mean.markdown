A more philosophical look at bootstrapping this week. We examine how bootstrapping is different to VC-backed 'startuping' and what it means for you to _make something_.

Cameron Koczon ([@fictivecameron](https://twitter.com/fictivecameron)) writes on The Pastry Box about the demonisation of VC... and points out that there's no need to. They're just aiming at something different from us bootstrappers.
