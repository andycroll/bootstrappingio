The big day: launch. We talk about how to prep, what not to do and what to do after.

_Off topic: Hi! I'm back! It was hard to get back on the 'horse' this week, after the break for [Brighton Ruby](http://brightonruby.com). Lesson learned, momentum is everything._


### [Want to Build and Launch Your First Product – Here’s What Not to Do](http://www.startupclarity.com/blog/launch-first-product-what-not-to-do/)

If I could condense great chunks of my advice for anyone working on something new, this article from [@StartupClarity](https://twitter.com/StartupClarity) would be it.


### [How to Land Your First Customers When You’re Unknown](http://casjam.com/your-first-customers/)

Three terrific and insightful case studies from [@casjam](http://twitter.com/casjam) on launching your product into markets when you don't already have an audience.

PS Get an audience. But mostly get a plan.


### [Three reasons product launches fail](http://nathanbarry.com/launchfail/)

Audience, excitement, urgency. A lack of any of these three can make your big launch go with a fizzle.

### [Hacker News, Techcrunch and Product Hunt: which is most effective to launch your product?](http://blog.frontapp.com/hacker-news-techcrunch-and-product-hunt-which-is-most-effective-to-launch-your-product-2/)

[@frontapp](http://twitter.com/frontapp) launched their product across three known 'sources' of early users. If you count 'source' to mean _place where I imagine all my users are but probably aren't_. I kid. Mostly.

They compare the incoming traffic and conversion from each. An interesting exercise, but bear in mind you might want to launch to a less random and judgemental audience!
