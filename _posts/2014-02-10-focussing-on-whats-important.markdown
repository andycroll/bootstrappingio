This week I've focussed on focus. From finding the time to do something for yourself, to concentrating on where you're already making a difference to using products that let you make more time or the stuff that makes your business unique.

### [The End of 37signals...](https://37signals.com)

I'm not going to turn this into a 'news' letter but when the creators of Rails and one of the companies who most bootstrappers look up to do something big, it's worth taking notice.

### [Don't End the Week with Nothing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing)

Patrick McKenzie, ([@patio11](http://twitter.com/patio11)) spins off an idea from his excellent [AMA](http://ama.betalist.com/patrick-mckenzie) where he declared:

"I have worked 70 hours this week for a giant megacorp. As of this instant, none of that work matters."

He's worked that thought up into an inspirational (monster) essay. Terrific stuff.

### [Real Competitors](http://bokardo.com/archives/real-competitors/)

I'm not gonna spoil this short thought by Joshua Porter ([@bokardo](http://twitter.com/bokardo)) but suffice to say its a great reminder to really prove that the things we're building are better than the tools people are already using.

### [Why Startups Should Choose B2B](http://blog.sourcing.io/choose-b2b)

Alex MacCaw ([@maccaw](https://twitter.com/maccaw)) has worked for Stripe and Twitter (so knows his stuff)and is now founding sourcing.io. It seems at this stage he's bootstrapping this effort and has good advice for product people.

### [The SaaS Behind our SaaS](http://blog.kickofflabs.com/saas-behind-our-saas/)

A vast list of products, from the guys at [@kickofflabs](https://twitter.com/kickofflabs), many of which I'd also personally endorse. The steer is is showing how you can use a few dollars a month to make your own time go further and let you concentrate on the things that make your product unique.
