I have taken a short break due to some RSI in my hands. I'm also thinking this is going to be a once a fortnight newsletter. But it is back on the horse time!

Here, massively late, are some interesting looks at 2014 from various bootstrapped companies. Including a couple you might not have read. I've tried to reach out beyond the bootstrapping echo chamber to find good examples of functional 'making stuff and selling it online' companies.

### [Bootstrappers 2014: Year in Review](http://www.startupclarity.com/blog/bootstrappers-2014-year-review/)

A summary collection of individual reviews from many bootstrappers who I've covered in these very pages.

_Particularly_ of note is the open books of [@patio11](http://twitter.com/patio11) in his [year in review](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/12/22/kalzumeus-software-year-in-review-2014/), where he opens up the previously closed books of Appointment Reminder (his main product). I think I'd imagined he was making more than he is, but he's still making a good living, more than many of us have achieved... and his level of detail (and thought) is super useful.


### [Hundreds & Thousands](http://blog.tito.io/posts/hundreds-and-thousands/)

As a customer of Tito and [@paulca](http://twittier.com/paulca) I've watched their growth with my happy face on. I even implored him face-to-face to continue to resist the lure of VC-money at the (tempting) stage his fantastic project is at.


### [Offscreen 2014 in Review](http://blog.offscreenmag.com/post/107066061866/2014-in-review)

Offscreen is an amazing project, a true independent _physical_ magazine with one guy at the heart of it: [@kaibrach](https://twitter.com/kaibrach).


### [The 2014 Panic Report](http://www.panic.com/blog/the-2014-panic-report/)

[@Panic](http://twitter.com/panic) are an enviable company. They've been writing Mac software _and_ profitable for over 20 years. And they seem to have fun.


### [Monument Valley in Numbers](http://blog.monumentvalleygame.com/blog/2015/1/15/monument-valley-in-numbers)

Monument Valley is a fantastic IOS and android game from [@ustwogames](https://twitter.com/ustwogames), its not scammy, there are no gems to buy, and frankly, it's a masterpiece. Never forget that the iOS App Store _for games_ is a 'hits' business.


### [Overcastâ€™s 2014 sales numbers](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/15/overcast-sales-numbers)

Overcast is an interesting example of a one man show. [@marcoarment](https://twitter.com/marcoarment) has it significant following in the podcast world. But the ongoing success of his iOS app cannot purely be down to a big sales spike on release.

He seems to be in the position to run overcast as a ongoing concern, due to his low costs, and his numbers allowed [@Metakite](https://twitter.com/Metakite) to further extrapolate [the shape of the App Store](http://metakite.com/blog/2015/01/the-shape-of-the-app-store/). It's possible to run a sustainable business, if you're careful.
