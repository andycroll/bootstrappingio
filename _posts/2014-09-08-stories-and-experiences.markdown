This week we're going to explore the stories of people who have made it through the first couple of hurdles of bootstrapping and actually shipped something.

A lot of these stories you could easily dismiss as 'great for that guy/girl' but the thing to learn is how they used their individual skill sets in creating their ventures and the takeaways you can glen from their success.


### [1 Year as a Digital Nomad - How to Build a Business by the Beach](http://www.slideshare.net/yongfook/1-year-as-a-digital-nomad-how-to-build-a-business-by-the-beach)

A friend of mine, [@yongfook](http://twitter.com/yongfook) (incredibly smart guy), details how he took his bootstrapped business from a couple of interviews, to a five figure USD monthly turnover.

He also did it from the beaches of South East Asia. Like I said, _smart guy_.


### [How running a SaaS startup differs from what I expected](http://www.happybootstrapper.com/2014/running-a-saas-startup/)

[@jaanakulmala](http://twitter.com/jaanakulmala) talks through her initial experiences after running her (at this point) 28 paying customer SaaS application. Lots of hard learned lessons in here.


### [5 things Iâ€™ve learned in 5 years of running a SaaS](http://mir.aculo.us/2013/11/27/5-things-ive-learned-in-5-years-of-running-a-saas/)

Superb list from [thomasfuchs](http://twitter.com/thomasfuchs) full to the brim with pragmatic advice from someone who has really walked the bootstrapper-walk.


### [How I build my minimum viable products](https://levels.io/how-i-build-my-minimum-viable-products/)

A interesting post on the technical approach [@levelsio](http://twitter.com/levelsio) takes to launching his fast products.

As a developer it's interesting to see the proven technical stack he's using... turns out your technology isn't your key differentiator.


### [3 Lessons in Building a Remote Startup to $11,500 in MRR](http://blog.hubstaff.com/building-a-remote-startup/)

There's some good thinking on pricing here.

[@dnevogt](https://twitter.com/dnevogt) casts an envying eye over SaaS businesses with higher monthly pricing than he is able to acheive.
