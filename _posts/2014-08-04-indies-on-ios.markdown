title: 'Indies on iOS'

Going slightly off topic this week, presuming that mostly readers of this list are 'web' people rather than 'app' people.

We're going to talk about the indie dream, particularly the road paved with gold that is the iOS App Store. Of course, it's a lot more complex than that.

There's a lot to learn from the discussion around this topic, whether you're building for the iPhone or not.


### [A Candid Look at Unreadâ€™s First Year](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year)

The post that sparked a lot of discussion, was from [@jaredsinclar](https://twitter.com/jaredsinclair) he covered his income from a _very_ polished iPhone RSS app.

It's also worth reading Jared's [immediate followup](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93233115970/on-promotion-and-marketing-a-response-to-critics-of) to some of the more simplistic critiques.


### [3 Years, 6 Months, and $0 MRR](http://retromocha.com/learn/3-years-6-months-and-0-mrr/)

In some ways a more extreme case that Jared's. The guys from Retro Mocha recount their somewhat dispiriting search for success building apps.


### [A Candid Look at the Financial Side of Building Mac Apps on Your Own](http://tyler.io/2014/07/a-candid-look-at-the-financial-side-of-building-mac-apps-on-your-own/)

A more positive spin, but from the Mac side of things from [@tylerhall](http://twitter.com/tylerhall). It's still a long road.


### [Pleco: Building a Business, Not an App](http://stratechery.com/2014/pleco-building-business-just-app/)

Another, more positive, case study of 'owning a niche' from [@monkbent](http://twitter.com/monkbent). In this case Pleco and Chinese dictionary.


### [App Store Pricing Models](https://medium.com/@stephenljohnson/app-store-pricing-models-e1194913a39a)

This article predates this week's discussions by several months. [@stephenljohnson](http://twitter.comstephenljohnson) discusses the option of using freemium pricing on the App Store and the compromises and effort you have to make to get things to work.


### [App Store Realities](https://medium.com/@sorthman/app-store-realities-7b54af3f574e)

[@sorthman](http://twitter.com/sorthman) takes another tack, given his early success with his time-tracking app: the lifestyle it enables.


### [Nobility of Effort](http://developingperspective.com/2014/07/30/192/)

A great final take from [@_davidsmith](http://twitter.com/_davidsmith).

> It is rather remarkable that we can even consider there to be a reasonable likelihood that if we do the thing that we love it will ultimately result in a sustainable living.
