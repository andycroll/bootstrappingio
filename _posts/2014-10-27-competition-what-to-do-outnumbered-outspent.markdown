So as a bootstrapper you don't have the tools (oodles of VC money) or the option to undercut (make all the things free!) that a funded startup or large incumbent might have.

But what do you have?


### [How Bootstrappers Can Compete Against Funded Startups And Get Customers](https://lessaccounting.com/blog/compete-with-funded-companies/)

Some great tactical advice from [@allanbranch](http://twitter.com/allanbranch) of LessEverything the self proclaimed 'cockroaches of the accounting software industry'.

However, the top comment to the question is written by [@patio11](http://twitter.com/patio11). It's hard to choose one quotable sentence over another!

Just. Great. Advice.

Another missive from the prolific [@alexmturnbull](http://twitter.com/alexmturnbull). This time on hiring as a small company, when the people that _you_ want could also work for super-global-mega-corps.


### [The Rip-offs & Making Our Original Game](http://asherv.com/threes/threemails/)

And now a sadder story, from [@ashervo](http://twitter.com/ashervo) of the rip offs that followed the publication of his (fabulous) iOS game, Threes.

Go and [download it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes%21/id779157948?mt=8) and marvel at its gorgeousness of sound, animation and one-more-go-ability. It's $2, buy an indie developer a third of a coffee.
