For those of you interested in last week's iOS indie here's a brief followup from the guy who kicked it all off. [Five Hard Lessons Learned from Unread](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93784230655/five-hard-lessons-learned-from-unread). It's definitely worth a read for anyone thinking of launching any kind of product.

Changing tack _completely_, this week we're talking about eBooks again.

My sporadic efforts to complete one of my [own books](http://andycroll.com/building-ruby-gems/) tell me that it's tough to get it out there. There's plenty of evidence that if you build an audience correctly, an ebook is a great first product.


### [My adventure in “pay what you want”](http://www.valhead.com/2014/08/06/my-adventure-sharing-my-book-as-pay-what-you-want/)

A fellow author in the Five Simple Steps stable [@vlh](https://twitter.com/vlh) shares her experience in the 'In Rainbows' model of pricing when the rights for her book suddenly reverted to her.


### [The complete guide to making a full-time salary from one book](http://nathanbarry.com/full-time-salary-book/)

Once again [@nathanbarry](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry) goes long and deep on a topic. This time continued promotion for ebooks.

Useful ideas given all the stories show that eBooks tend to be a 'massive first week' and then rapidly tail off.


### [Creating eBooks](http://www.creating-ebooks.com)

When the publisher of [HTML Email](http://andycroll.com/html-email/) shut down earlier this year (now subsequently reopened at [@fivesimplesteps](https://twitter.com/fivesimplesteps)) they released a great technical resource sharing the mechanics how they put together their ebooks.


### [How Samuel Hulick made over $37,000 with his self-published book](http://nathanbarry.com/samuel-hulick-37000-self-published-book/)

[@SamuelHulick](https://twitter.com/SamuelHulick) transformed the lessons in the case studies on his site useronboard.com into a an ebook. And the audience he'd built led him to a significantly successful launch.


### [$16,920.12 earned, 1054 copies sold: Lessons learned from a year as a self-published author](http://blog.leanpub.com/2014/01/leanpub-ebook-sales-guest-post.html)

A post on the blog of the popular (as far as I can tell) [@leanpub](https://twitter.com/leanpub) blog. Here [@josh_earl](https://twitter.com/josh_earl) goes into incredible detail (including financials) on his self-published book.
