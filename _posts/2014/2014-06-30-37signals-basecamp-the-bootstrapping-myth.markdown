title: '37signals/Basecamp: The Bootstrapping Myth?'
layout: post

Many bootstrappers look up to the guys from [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com) (prevously known as 37signals). A design studio turned privately-owned and directed software company with a (relatively) small staff, great work environment and multi-million dollar revenue.

Is the 37signals to Basecamp story a bootstrapper's myth? Are we chasing an unachievable dream?


### [The Myth of the Design Studio Turned Product Company](https://medium.com/@freshtilledsoil/the-myth-of-the-design-studio-turned-product-company-fceb670aa74a)

So here's an interesting article about the design studio, [@freshtilledsoil](http://twitter.com/freshtilledsoil) about the distraction of trying to become a product-focussed business.

There's good stuff in here about focus and required skill sets, but the hyperbole does not serve the article well... as we'll see below.


### [There's No Myth, Only Years Of Hard Work](https://lessaccounting.com/blog/service-business-37signals/)

[@allanbranch](http://twitter.com/allanbranch) of LessAccounting, another self-funded software business gets busting some of the myths of the SaaS product.

There's a lot of hard earned wisdom in here...


### [37signals isn't mythical, you're not paying attention](http://unicornfree.com/2013/37signals-isnt-mythical-youre-not-paying-attention)

[@amyhoy](http://twitter.com/amyhoy) is in _less generous_ mood. She takes apart the original article by pointing out the lack of understanding of what 37signals actually did to become the product company they are today.

As [her original article on building a small product](http://unicornfree.com/2013/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first) points out, 37signals originally packaged up knowledge into ebooks and sold them.


### [The Great Discontent: Jason Fried](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/jason-fried)

A terrific career spanning interview with Jason Fried, one of the co-founders of Basecamp.

It's interesting to compare this [interview from 2005](http://www.workhappy.net/2005/09/interview_with_.html) with the more recent one. There hasn't been a great change in Jason's modus operandi. Perhaps merely greater focus.


### [One Hit Wonder](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3755-one-hit-wonder)

Here Basecamp's other founder. [@dhh](http://twitter.com/dhh) writes what I've heard him say in interviews before... being happy with a 'one hit wonder'.

Let's face it, it's tough enough to have the single hit in the first place.
