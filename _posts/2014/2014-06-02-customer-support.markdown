I'm a great believer in using the 'humans behind the company' when you talk to customers. It's one of the reasons I like small companies not hiding their smallness.

As a customer, one of the greatest things that can happen is getting an email from 'someone important' at a company in response to a support request. When you get a reply from the founder of a company, you feel important and know you're being heard.

One of my rules: if you email me, I'll email back. It might take me a bit, but I will!

In this article for Smashing Magazine, [@rachelandrew](http://twitter.com/rachelandrew) gives a thourough run down of how she went about providing support for Perch. I could be wrong but I'm sure this chapter went on to be an entire chapter of [her book](http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/books/the-profitable-side-project).


### [Do not Reply](http://blog.besnappy.com/2014/04/do-not-reply-email/)

As you'd expect of the blog of an email support tool, the Snappy blog is full of useful advice. Here [@alyssamazzina](https://twitter.com/alyssamazzina) talks about no_reply@thisstupidcompany.com email addresses.

Snappy also provide a free PDF named [Customer Support for Bootstrappers](http://besnappy.com/books/customer-support-bootstrappers) which provides a good starting point to think about running your own support efforts.
