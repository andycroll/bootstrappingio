A short selection of links to kick off this inaugural edition of
[Bootstrapping IO](http://bootstrapping.io). Every week we'll bring
you a handful of links that are *actually relevant* to getting your product
business off the ground.

No VCs, no spectacular exits, no nonsense hype, just useful content for people
making businesses the new old-fashioned way: one customer at a time.

This week, as we're still just within reach of New Year, here's a few 2013
reviews from the owners of successful product businesses.

### [Kalzumeus Software: Year in Review 2013](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/01/06/kalzumeus-software-year-in-review-2013/)

Patrick McKenzie ([@patio11](http://twitter.com/patio11)), has been successfully
building his product business for a number of years. While the figures for his
new(ish) Appointment Reminder product are not included in this round up, it's
still good to see this one man product army share so much information.

geting yourself a 'bacon biz' ever since she started Freckle. It seems to be her
life's mission to help people do the same. Here she breaks down her entire
growth history. A treasure trove of *steady* growth data to a sustaining
business!

In the last two years Natahn Barry ([@nathanbarry](http://twitter.com/nathanbarry))
has gone from wage slave to self-publisher extraordinaire, with three book
lauches in 2013. Here's how his income stacked up.

### [LetterBoxed 2013 Review](http://letterboxd.com/2013/)

A beautiful summary of the year's films from this bootstrapped, film-based
social network. No revenue figures, just inspirational design from a little
company funded entirely by its users.

Until next time...
