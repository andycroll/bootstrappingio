Some early and not so early tales (with numbers) of SaaS businesses and some good learning when a Kickstarter didn't go well.


### [Making SummaList: 1 Week & $125 MRR Later](http://adii.me/making-summalist/)

Love that [@adii](http://twitter.com/adii) is sharing his uncertain process in product creation after his huge success at WooThemes, even when the early numbers are 'small'.


### [From Idea to $5000 a Month in 5 Months](https://www.baremetrics.io/blog/idea-to-5000-in-5-months)

The CEO of baremetrics, [@shpigford](http://twitter.com/shpigford), gave a well-received presentation at MicroConf a couple of weeks back. This is the more digestible (written!) version.

[These are the slides from the presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/shpigford/from-idea-to-5000-dollars-a-month-in-5-months).

Don't forget that [baremetric's demo](https://www.baremetrics.io/blog/inside-our-financials-baremetrics-demo) uses their own metrics, how's that for dogfooding?


### [Introducing the Public Buffer Revenue Dashboard: Our Real-Time Numbers for Monthly Revenue, Paying Customers and More](http://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-public-revenue-dashboard/)

I'm a massive fan of Buffer's open approach to business (if not their product necessarily, long story) so when [@joelgascoigne](http://twitter.com/joelgascoigne) found out about Baremetric's dashboard demo (see above) Buffer did the same.


### [Lessons Learned Growing our Startup to $50,000 in Monthly Revenue](http://www.groovehq.com/blog/getting-to-50k)

Groove have been systematically reporting on their continued growth, with a weekly blog post. In the months since they started blogging, their MRR has gone from $35k to $50k.

A great post with some collected learning from [@alexmturnbull](http://twitter.com/alexmturnbull), on what writing has forced them to focus on: mostly stuff they should have been doing anyway.


### [3 things my failed Kickstarter taught me](http://pyskool.com/3-things-failed-kickstarter-taught/)

And the story of an ebook Kickstarter that didn't make it. The book is being resurrected though.
