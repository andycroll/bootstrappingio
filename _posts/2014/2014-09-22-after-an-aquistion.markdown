title: 'After an Acquisition'

Cautionary tales this week from those who have had their companies acquired.

Acquisition whilst monetarily great for the company owners (and investors) can lead to disillusionment... you started so you wouldn't have a boss remember!

Most of us would take the cash I'm sure, but with bootstrapping you at least have a choice to design a 'lifestyle business' that doesn't _need_ an out rather than be on the single track to acquisition or death.

You may remember a great little server hosting company, Slicehost, it was bought by Rackspace.

Here a great series of video interviews with the founders, [@seats](https://twitter.com/seats) & [@zenmatt](https://twitter.com/zenmatt), about what happened next.


### [The Return of Upcoming](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/the-return-of-upcomingorg)

Around the beginnings of the Web 2.0 era a couple of site sold to Yahoo. One was Flickr which continues on, but missed the explosion of the Smartphone era.

Another was Upcoming, an event directory. Here it's original founder [@waxpancake](http://twitter.com/waxpancake) is running a kickstarter to resurrect it after the Yahoo sunset.


### [The Myth of Venture Capital](http://recode.net/2014/09/11/the-myth-of-venture-capital/)

Founder & CEO of Shutterstock, [@jonoringer](https://twitter.com/jonoringer) has an interesting tale.

He actually did it. Took a company from nothing to _floating on the stock market_ funded by nothing except his customers. Awesome stuff.


### [Bad Notes on Venture Capital](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/09/17/bad-notes-on-venture-capital/)

Finally, an article that reminds me why I didn't like being a founder in VC-world. Here's an article bemoaning the particular legal, financial vehicle in use for lots of pre-revenue startups.

Favourite/worst sentence in the whole piece...

> But do you want to start a relationship with your most important supplier – that of capital to fuel your business – by avoiding talking about his or her expectations in terms of rights or privileges?

It says everything about what troubles me about VC-world. The focus on your "most important supplier of capital": your investor, _not_ your customers. And that's why so many 'startups' get it wrong.

Rant over.
