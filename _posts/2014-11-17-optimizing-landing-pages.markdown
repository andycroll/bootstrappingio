We've covered landing pages a bit before but there's so much good content (and they are so important) there's no harm in covering them again!


### [Marketing Site Design for Startups](https://ryanbattles.com/post/marketing-site-design-for-startups)

An epic on marketing pages from [@ryanbattles](http://twitter.com/ryanbattles). Once you get past the slightly aggressive 'give me your email' popups (two!) theres a bunch of great thinking and wisdom in here.


### [Conversion Optimization in Practice: Baconbiz 2013 Presentation](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/05/12/conversion-optimization-in-practice-baconbiz-2013-presentation/)

A great video (and transcript) from 2013's BaconBizConf where [@patio11](http://twitter.com/patio11) takes apart [@amyhoy](http://twitter.com/amyhoy)'s landing page for Freckle, and puts it back together live on stage.

Fascinating.


### [10 Ways to Build Trust on Your Landing Page](http://uxmovement.com/content/10-ways-to-build-trust-on-your-landing-page/)

A list post, but a good (succinct) one. [@julerr](https://twitter.com/julerr) provides a great checklist to help you ensure you're not making any glaring mistakes.

_Also her Twitter background is [Purple Tentacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Tentacle), so she rocks._
