I'm obviously skirting a bit close to the Gmail spam triggers with that title.

We're looking at tactics, stories and experience about working on your _thing_ while doing something else for the roof over your head.

### [Ways to bootstrap a startup: on the side](https://medium.com/buffer-posts/a2b85636aa63)

Buffer have gone on to raise money and plow the VC-funded route (although with some fascinating openness on their blog).

Here's a post from [@joelgascoigne](http://twitter.com/joelgascoigne) in 2011 as he worked on Buffer as a side project.

### [Your 60-Hour Work Week Is Not A Badge Of Honour](http://jeffarchibald.ca/60-hour-work-week-badge-honour/)

Something to bear in mind, from [@jeff_archibald](http://twitter.com/jeff_archibald), when you are attempting to launch something on the side if the hours you can end up working.

Be careful to steer clear of the "I'm working **so** hard" humblebrag. It's not healthy, it's a _problem_.

### [Where do you find the time for side projects](http://justinjackson.ca/where-do-you-find-the-time-for-side-projects/)

The prolific [@mijustin](http://twitter.com/mijustin) has four children. Let that sink in for a minute.

Here he shares his tactics for getting stuff done off the side of his desk, heads up... it's not "watches Game of Thrones".

### [Failure to Think Like An Investor](http://unicornfree.com/2014/failure-the-hourly-mindset)

A great read from [@amyhoy](http://twitter.com/amyhoy) about the problems with not thinking like an investor in terms of your own time.

### [On Not Hiring](http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2011/01/on-not-hiring.html)

[@yegg](https://twitter.com/yegg) is the founder of DuckDuckGo, a search engine *taking on google*.

This article is from 2011, but describes how far he was able to get without hiring anyone. He got _help_ sure, but didn't hire. Food for thought, particularly as bootstrappers.
