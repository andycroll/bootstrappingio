title: 'Money Ranting'

One of the things I found hardest as a founder of an early stage VC-funded startup was dealing with money. Not the mechanics, the morals and politics.

I didn't like spending "other people's" money. I felt bad when experiments failed. And we at least had a business model where people gave us money for things, we weren't chasing _eyeballs_.

That's one of the reasons I'm _all in_ on bootstrapping/consulting for any of my own future business escapades.

When you bootstrap, it kinda makes the 'having a way to make money' part of business, a bit more of a focus.

> What they (VCs) are doing is optimizing for a very specific outcome. Share that alignment, or don’t take their money.

Heads up, chances are you probably don't share their alignment.
