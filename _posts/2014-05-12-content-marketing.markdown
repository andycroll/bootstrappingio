As a designer/developer I'm a terrible writer. Not in the sense of not being able to write coherently but in the sense of working out what I should be writing about. My sporadic [personal blog](http://andycroll.com) is testament to that!

Here's a group of articles that encompass using original writing to generate traffic for your products.

A terrific 'how to' from [@backlinko](http://twitter.com/backlinko) on [@noahkagan](http://twitter.com/noahkagan)'s blog on building up content that generates serious traffic, some ideas I wouldn't have even thought of, and some tactics I don't know whether I _like_. But **so** worth a read.

Once you've written that content, how do you get people to read it? [@mijackson](http://twitter.com/mijackson) has some ideas.
