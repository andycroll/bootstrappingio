# Happy Friday

Happy Friday. We made it through another week… *together* _(puts hand on your hand, looks meaningfully into your eyes, slowly leans in for a kiss…)_

Ahem. Sorry. Where was I? 

Right! Friday! Happy Friday!

I’m talking about Burning Man again today. If you don’t give a fig about Burning Man, that’s awesome! Here are three interviews for you to listen to, if you’d like:

- I was on The Freelancer’s Show to talk about Podcast Outreach for Consultants ([https://devchat.tv/freelancers/204-fs-podcast-outreach-with-kai-davis][1])
- WP-Tonic invited me on to chat about Freelancing and Digital Outreach ([https://www.wp-tonic.com/podcast/133-kai-davis-digital-outreach-podcast/][2])
- The wonderful Andy Baldacci had me on his podcast to talk about the power of podcast tours ([http://andybaldacci.com/podcast/kai-davis-startup-podcast-tour/][3])

I hope you have a wonderful weekend — I’ll be spending mine in the garage with some power tools!

***** 
Thank you to everyone who responded volunteering to help with buying Burning Man tickets. 

If you responded to yesterday’s email, keep your eyes open for a follow-up email from me tomorrow with more details. 

If you missed yesterday’s email, **I’m looking for help buying Burning Man tickets for my Burning Man camp**. Here’s a link to yesterday’s email with all the details: [https://www.getdrip.com/deliveries/r7wzovwdqofjwww2atuk][4]

**If you are interested and available to help order Burning Man tickets, just reply to this email with a ‘Heck yeah, I can help! **

A number of you had _excellent_ questions. Here are some answers:

**Kai, what if you end up with _too many_ tickets?**

We’ll sell the tickets, at face value, to individuals attending Burning Man and other camps that need tickets. 

I have no desire nor intention to sell tickets at a profit. That would go against what Burning Man stands for. I have no desire to make a profit off of these tickets. 

Extra Tickets =\> Sold at cost to burners. 

**Kai, how will the reimbursement work?**

- When you buy your tickets, you’ll enter in my address as the shipping address. 
- When you receive your receipt, you’ll forward it to me, so I know you were successful in acquiring tickets (🎉)
- Once I receive your receipt, I’ll reimburse you for your cost ($425/ticket, so $850 for two tickets) through PayPal _(please allow 3-5 days for the reimbursements. Computers. You know)_. 

If you can help out with this, first, _thank you_. Second, just reply to this email with a short “I’m in!”. Third, I’ll have an email to you this weekend with more information _(times, dates, etc.)_ over the weekend. 

Have a wonderful weekend.

Excelsior!

Kai
